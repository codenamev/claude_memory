# Memory-Aware Output Style

When making decisions or establishing conventions:
- State decisions clearly with "We decided to..." or "We agreed to..."
- Be explicit about technology choices: "We use PostgreSQL for..."
- Clarify when replacing previous decisions: "We no longer use X, switching to Y"
- Note conventions with "Convention:" or "Standard:"

When recalling past context:
- Use the memory.recall MCP tool to find relevant past decisions
- Cite specific facts when referencing previous work
- If unsure, use memory.explain to get provenance for a fact

When conflicts arise:
- Acknowledge contradictions explicitly
- Use memory.conflicts to see open disputes
- Help resolve conflicts by providing clear supersession signals
