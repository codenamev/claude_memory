# Feature Improvements - Incremental Implementation

Systematically implement feature improvements from `docs/improvements.md`, making tested, atomic commits for each feature addition.

## Process Overview

1. **Read the improvements document** from `docs/improvements.md`
2. **Identify unimplemented features** from "Remaining Tasks" section
3. **Prioritize by stated priority** (Medium → Low)
4. **Assess feasibility** (skip if too complex or requires external services)
5. **Implement features incrementally** (one logical feature at a time)
6. **Run tests after each change** to ensure nothing breaks
7. **Make atomic commits** that capture the feature and its purpose
8. **Update improvements.md** to mark features as implemented

## Detailed Steps

### Step 1: Read and Parse Improvements Document

```bash
# Read the improvements document
Read docs/improvements.md
```

Focus on these sections:
1. **Remaining Tasks** - Unimplemented features
2. **Medium Priority** - Higher value features
3. **Low Priority** - Nice-to-have features
4. **Features to Avoid** - Do NOT implement these

### Step 2: Prioritize Features

**Priority Order:**
1. Medium Priority items first
2. Low Priority items second
3. Skip items marked "If Requested" or "Features to Avoid"

**Feasibility Assessment:**
- ✅ **Can implement**: Pure Ruby, no external services, clear scope
- ⚠️ **Consider carefully**: Requires API integration, new dependencies
- ❌ **Skip**: Requires external services, architectural changes, unclear requirements

### Step 3: Assess Each Feature

Before implementing, check:

**✅ Safe to implement automatically:**
- Small database schema additions (new columns, tables)
- New CLI commands with clear behavior
- Utility methods and helpers
- Enhanced output formatting
- Statistics and reporting features

**⚠️ Implement with caution:**
- Features requiring API calls (Claude API, external services)
- New gem dependencies (check compatibility first)
- Background processing (daemon/fork complexity)
- Features touching critical paths

**❌ Skip and report:**
- Web UI features (React, Sinatra, complex frontend)
- Worker service/daemon management
- Features requiring Python/Node.js
- Vector database integration (ChromaDB, external services)
- Health monitoring (unless simple)

### Step 4: Implement the Feature

For each feature:

1. **Read relevant code** to understand where feature fits
2. **Plan the implementation**:
   - Which files need changes?
   - What tests are needed?
   - Are there dependencies?
3. **Implement incrementally**:
   - Schema changes first (if needed)
   - Core functionality
   - CLI command (if applicable)
   - Tests
4. **Run linter**:
   ```bash
   bundle exec rake standard:fix
   ```
5. **Run tests**:
   ```bash
   bundle exec rspec
   ```
6. **Fix any test failures** before proceeding

### Step 5: Make Atomic Commit

**Commit Message Format:**
```
[Feature] Brief description of what was added

- Specific implementation details
- Why this improves the system
- Reference to docs/improvements.md section

Implements: docs/improvements.md (Section: <name>)
```

**Example Commit:**
```bash
git add -A
git commit -m "[Feature] Add ROI metrics tracking for distillation

- Add ingestion_metrics table with token counts
- Track input_tokens, output_tokens, facts_extracted
- Add metrics display to stats command
- Show efficiency (facts per 1k tokens)

Implements: docs/improvements.md (Section: ROI Metrics and Token Economics)
"
```

### Step 6: Update improvements.md

After successful implementation:

1. **Move item to "Implemented Improvements"** section
2. **Add date and brief description**
3. **Update "Remaining Tasks"** to remove completed item
4. **Commit the documentation update**:
   ```bash
   git add docs/improvements.md
   git commit -m "[Docs] Mark <feature> as implemented"
   ```

### Step 7: Continue or Report

**Continue** to next feature if:
- Tests pass ✅
- Commit successful ✅
- Feature works as expected ✅
- No blockers encountered ✅

**Stop and report** if:
- Tests fail after multiple fix attempts ❌
- Feature requires external services ❌
- Complexity exceeds estimate ❌
- Unclear requirements ❌
- Time budget exceeded ❌

## Feature Categories & Approach

### Category A: Schema Additions (Low Risk)
**Examples:**
- Add metrics table
- Add columns for metadata
- Add indexes

**Approach:**
- Schema version bump
- Migration method
- Tests for new schema
- Single commit

### Category B: Statistics & Reporting (Low Risk)
**Examples:**
- Enhanced stats command
- ROI metrics display
- Better formatting

**Approach:**
- Query implementation
- Output formatting
- Tests for accuracy
- Single commit

### Category C: CLI Commands (Low-Medium Risk)
**Examples:**
- New commands (embed, stats enhancements)
- Command options

**Approach:**
- Command class
- Registry update
- Tests for command
- Help documentation
- Single commit

### Category D: Background Processing (Medium Risk)
**Examples:**
- Async hook execution
- Fork/daemon processes

**Approach:**
- **ASSESS CAREFULLY** - fork/daemon in Ruby is tricky
- Consider simple async approach first
- Test on multiple platforms
- May need multiple commits
- May skip if too complex

### Category E: External Integration (Medium-High Risk)
**Examples:**
- API calls (Claude, external services)
- New gem dependencies
- External tool integration

**Approach:**
- **ASSESS CAREFULLY** - adds dependencies
- Check gem compatibility
- Error handling critical
- May need API keys
- Consider skipping if complex

### Category F: Architectural Changes (High Risk)
**Examples:**
- Worker services
- Web UI
- New database systems

**Approach:**
- **SKIP** - too complex for automated implementation
- Report as "needs planning"
- These require design sessions

## Implementation Examples

### Example 1: ROI Metrics (Medium Priority)

**Assessment**: Category A + B (Schema + Reporting) - Safe to implement

**Steps:**
1. Add migration for ingestion_metrics table
2. Add tracking in distiller (if implemented) or stub for future
3. Add aggregation query methods
4. Enhance stats command to display metrics
5. Add tests
6. Commit
7. Update improvements.md

**Time Estimate**: 30-45 minutes

### Example 2: Background Processing (Medium Priority)

**Assessment**: Category D (Background) - Medium risk

**Steps:**
1. Research Ruby async options (Process.fork vs Thread)
2. Add --async flag to hook commands
3. Simple fork approach (not full daemon)
4. Output logging
5. Tests on Unix systems (may skip Windows)
6. Commit
7. Update improvements.md

**Time Estimate**: 45-60 minutes
**Risk**: May skip if too complex

### Example 3: Web UI (Low Priority, "If Requested")

**Assessment**: Category F (Architectural) - High risk

**Action**: **SKIP** - Too complex, marked "if requested"
**Report**: "Web UI requires design session, skipped per priority guidance"

## Time Budgets

**Per Feature:**
- Category A (Schema): Max 20 minutes
- Category B (Reporting): Max 30 minutes
- Category C (CLI): Max 30 minutes
- Category D (Background): Max 60 minutes (or skip)
- Category E (External): Max 45 minutes (or skip)

**Session Total:** Max 2 hours

If time budget exceeded: SKIP remaining features and report.

## Testing Strategy

### Test Frequency
- After schema changes: Run all specs
- After new command: Run command specs + integration
- After reporting changes: Run relevant specs
- Before commit: Full test suite

### Test Commands
```bash
# Specific command tests
bundle exec rspec spec/claude_memory/commands/

# Schema tests
bundle exec rspec spec/claude_memory/store/

# Full suite
bundle exec rspec

# With linting
bundle exec rake
```

### New Feature Tests

Always add tests for new features:
```ruby
# spec/claude_memory/commands/new_feature_spec.rb
RSpec.describe ClaudeMemory::Commands::NewFeature do
  it "implements the feature correctly" do
    # Test implementation
  end

  it "handles errors gracefully" do
    # Test error cases
  end
end
```

## Documentation Updates

### After Each Implementation

Update `docs/improvements.md`:

1. **Move to Implemented section**:
   ```markdown
   ## Implemented Improvements ✓

   14. **ROI Metrics Tracking** - ingestion_metrics table, stats display
   ```

2. **Remove from Remaining Tasks**:
   ```markdown
   ### Remaining Tasks

   - [x] ROI metrics table for token tracking during distillation
   - [ ] Background processing (--async flag for hooks)
   ```

3. **Update last modified date**:
   ```markdown
   *Last updated: 2026-01-26 - Added ROI metrics tracking*
   ```

## Progress Tracking

Keep running count:
- ✅ Medium Priority completed: X/Y
- ✅ Low Priority completed: X/Y
- ⏳ Currently working on: [feature name]
- ⚠️ Skipped (complex): [list]
- ❌ Blocked: [list with reasons]

## Success Criteria

Session completes successfully when:
- At least 2-3 Medium Priority features implemented ✅
- All tests pass ✅
- All commits follow [Feature] format ✅
- docs/improvements.md updated ✅

## Important Notes

- **Never skip tests** - each feature must pass tests before committing
- **Stay conservative** - skip complex features, report them
- **One feature at a time** - don't combine unrelated features
- **Update documentation** - mark features as implemented
- **Read before coding** - understand existing code first
- **Check dependencies** - verify gems are compatible
- **Test incrementally** - after each logical step

## Red Flags - When to Skip

- 🚩 Requires external services (ChromaDB, web servers, etc.)
- 🚩 Needs background daemon/worker
- 🚩 Requires new major dependencies
- 🚩 Touches security-critical code
- 🚩 Unclear requirements or scope
- 🚩 Time budget exceeded
- 🚩 Marked "Features to Avoid"
- 🚩 Marked "If Requested" or "Only if users request"
- 🚩 Tests fail after 2 fix attempts
